# Research Command

Conduct structured research following standardized workflow. Creates research documents for each research topic/question and extracts requirements discovered during research.

---

## Configuration

**Path Detection:**

This command supports multiple project organization patterns:

1. **Dev-Infra Structure (default):**
   - Research: `admin/research/[topic]/`
   - Requirements: `admin/research/[topic]/requirements.md`
   - Explorations: `admin/explorations/[topic]/`

2. **Template Structure (for generated projects):**
   - Research: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/`
   - Requirements: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/requirements.md`
   - Explorations: `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/[topic]/`

3. **Project-Wide Structure:**
   - Research: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/`
   - Requirements: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/requirements.md`
   - Explorations: `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/[topic]/`

**Topic Detection:**
- Use `--topic` option if provided
- Otherwise, auto-detect from input source
- Sanitize topic name (kebab-case, no spaces)

---

## Workflow Overview

**When to use:**

- After exploration identifies research topics
- When reflect artifacts identify opportunities needing research
- To conduct structured research on a specific topic

**Key principle:** Follow standardized research workflow, create documents for each research topic, extract requirements discovered during research.

**Workflow:**
```
/research [topic] --from-explore [topic]
  → Reads research topics from exploration
  → Creates research hub
  → Creates research document for each topic
  → Extracts requirements
  → Outputs: Research documents + requirements.md
```

---

## Usage

**Command:** `/research [topic] [--from-explore|--from-reflect|--topic] [options]`

**Examples:**

- `/research auth-system --from-explore new-authentication-system` - Research topics from exploration
- `/research ci-optimization --from-reflect reflection-project-2025-12-07.md` - Research opportunities from reflection
- `/research database-choice --topic "PostgreSQL vs MongoDB"` - Direct research topic
- `/research --dry-run` - Show what would be created without creating files

**Options:**

- `--from-explore [explore-topic]` - Read research topics from exploration document
- `--from-reflect [reflection-file]` - Read opportunities from reflection artifacts
- `--topic [topic]` - Direct topic specification (if not using --from-explore or --from-reflect)
- `--dry-run` - Show what would be created without creating files

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify Research Source

**Determine input source:**

1. **From Exploration (`--from-explore`):**
   - **Dev-Infra:** Read `admin/explorations/[explore-topic]/research-topics.md`
   - **Template Structure:** Read `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/[explore-topic]/research-topics.md`
   - Extract research topics/questions
   - Use explore-topic as research topic name (or use --topic to override)

2. **From Reflection (`--from-reflect`):**
   - Read reflection document
   - Extract "Actionable Suggestions" or "Opportunities for Improvement"
   - Convert suggestions to research topics
   - Use topic from command or prompt user

3. **Direct Topic (`--topic` or no flag):**
   - Use provided topic
   - Prompt user for research questions if needed

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Research source identified
- [ ] Research topics extracted
- [ ] Topic name determined

### 2. Create Research Hub

**Location Detection:**

- **Dev-Infra:** `admin/research/[topic]/`
- **Template Structure:** `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/`
- **Project-Wide:** `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/`

**Auto-detection:**
- Check if `admin/research/` exists → use dev-infra structure
- Check if `docs/maintainers/research/` exists → use template structure
- Otherwise → use project-wide structure

**Directory structure:**

```
research/[topic]/
├── README.md                    # Research hub
├── research-[question-1].md     # Research document for question 1
├── research-[question-2].md     # Research document for question 2
├── research-summary.md          # Summary of all research
└── requirements.md              # Requirements discovered during research
```
