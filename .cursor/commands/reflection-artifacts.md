# Reflection Artifacts Command

Extracts structured planning artifacts from reflection documents. Creates feature plans, release checklists, CI/CD improvement plans, and other actionable documents ready for implementation.

---

## Configuration

**Reflection Path Detection:**

This command supports multiple reflection organization patterns:

1. **Feature-Specific Reflections (default):**
   - Path: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/reflections/reflection-*.md`
   - Feature name auto-detected from context or configuration

2. **Project-Wide Reflections:**
   - Path: `docs/maintainers/planning/notes/reflections/reflection-*.md`
   - Used when no feature structure exists

3. **Alternative Reflection Locations:**
   - `docs/maintainers/planning/reflections/reflection-*.md`
   - `docs/maintainers/reflections/reflection-*.md`
   - Configurable via project configuration

**Feature Detection:**

- Use `--feature` option if provided
- Otherwise, auto-detect:
  - Check if `docs/maintainers/planning/features/` exists
  - If single feature exists, use that feature name
  - If multiple features exist, search for reflection files in each
  - If no features exist, use project-wide structure

**Artifact Output Paths:**

- **Release Artifacts:** `docs/maintainers/planning/releases/[version]/`
- **Feature Artifacts:** `docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/`
- **CI/CD Artifacts:** `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/[improvement-name]/`
- **Infrastructure Artifacts:** `docs/maintainers/planning/infrastructure/[improvement-name]/` (if exists)

---

## Workflow Overview

**When to use:**

- After creating a reflection document with `/reflect`
- To extract actionable suggestions into structured planning artifacts
- Before planning next stage (feature, release, infrastructure)

**Key principle:** Transform reflection insights into structured, actionable planning artifacts following established templates.

---

## Usage

**Command:** `/reflection-artifacts [reflection-file] [options]`

**Examples:**

- `/reflection-artifacts` - Extract artifacts from latest reflection (default)
- `/reflection-artifacts reflection-2025-12-07-mvp-complete.md` - Use specific reflection file
- `/reflection-artifacts --type release` - Only generate release artifacts
- `/reflection-artifacts --type feature` - Only generate feature artifacts
- `/reflection-artifacts --type all` - Generate all artifact types (default)
- `/reflection-artifacts --output-dir releases/v0.1.0` - Custom output directory
- `/reflection-artifacts --dry-run` - Show what would be created without creating files
- `/reflection-artifacts --feature my-feature` - Specify feature name

**Options:**

- `--from-reflection FILE` - Specify reflection file (default: latest in reflections/)
- `--feature [name]` - Specify feature name (overrides auto-detection)
- `--type TYPE` - Artifact type to generate (`feature`, `release`, `ci-cd`, `infrastructure`, `all`)
- `--output-dir DIR` - Custom output directory (default: appropriate planning directory)
- `--dry-run` - Show artifact plan without creating files

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify Reflection File

**Detect feature name:**

- Use `--feature` option if provided
- Otherwise, auto-detect:
  - Check if `docs/maintainers/planning/features/` exists
  - If single feature exists, use that feature name
  - If multiple features exist, search for reflection files in each
  - If no features exist, use project-wide structure

**Default behavior:**

- Find latest reflection file in:
  - Feature-specific: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/reflections/reflection-*.md`
  - Project-wide: `docs/maintainers/planning/notes/reflections/reflection-*.md`
  - Alternative: `docs/maintainers/planning/reflections/reflection-*.md`
- Sort by date (most recent first)
- Use latest reflection file

**Manual specification:**

- Use provided reflection file path
- Verify file exists and is readable

**Commands:**

```bash
# Find latest reflection (project-wide)
ls -t docs/maintainers/planning/notes/reflections/reflection-*.md | head -1

# Find latest reflection (feature-specific)
ls -t docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/reflections/reflection-*.md | head -1

# Check if reflection file exists
ls docs/maintainers/planning/notes/reflections/reflection-2025-12-07-mvp-complete.md
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Feature name detected or specified
- [ ] Reflection file identified (or using default)
- [ ] File exists and is readable
- [ ] File contains "Actionable Suggestions" section

---

### 2. Parse Reflection Document

**Extract from reflection file:**

- "Actionable Suggestions" section
- "Recommended Next Steps" section
- "Opportunities for Improvement" section
- "Potential Issues" section
- Current state information
- Key metrics

**Parse actionable suggestions:**

- Extract suggestions by priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Categorize by type (feature, release, ci-cd, infrastructure)
- Extract effort estimates
- Extract benefits and next steps

**Example parsing:**

```markdown
### High Priority

#### 1. Create Release Management Structure

**Category:** Release Management  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Effort:** MEDIUM (2-3 hours)

**Suggestion:**
Create release directory structure and templates...

**Next Steps:**
1. Create release directory structure
2. Create release checklist template
...
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Reflection document parsed
- [ ] Actionable suggestions extracted
- [ ] Suggestions categorized by type
- [ ] Priority and effort extracted

---

### 3. Categorize Suggestions by Type

**Categorization logic:**

1. **Release Management:**
   - Keywords: "release", "version", "tag", "changelog", "release notes"
   - Examples: "Create release checklist", "Prepare MVP release"

2. **Feature Planning:**
   - Keywords: "feature", "new feature", "implement", "add capability"
   - Examples: "Add new feature", "Implement feature X"

3. **CI/CD Improvements:**
   - Keywords: "ci", "cd", "pipeline", "automation", "deployment"
   - Examples: "Improve CI pipeline", "Add deployment automation"

4. **Infrastructure:**
   - Keywords: "infrastructure", "devops", "monitoring", "logging"
   - Examples: "Set up monitoring", "Improve logging"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Suggestions categorized by type
- [ ] Each suggestion assigned to appropriate category
- [ ] Categories verified

---

### 4. Generate Artifacts by Type

- Verify file path is correct
- May need to run `/reflect` first
- Check alternative reflection locations

### Issue: No Actionable Suggestions

**Solution:**

- Check if reflection contains "Actionable Suggestions" section
- Reflection may need to be updated with suggestions
- May need to run `/reflect` with different options

### Issue: Artifact Type Ambiguous

**Solution:**

- Review suggestion keywords
- Manually categorize if needed
- Use `--type` option to force specific type

### Issue: Directory Already Exists

**Solution:**

- Check if artifacts already exist
- Update existing artifacts if needed
- Use `--output-dir` to specify different location

---

## Tips

### Before Running

- Ensure reflection document is complete
- Verify "Actionable Suggestions" section exists
- Review reflection for clear suggestions

### During Artifact Creation

- Review extracted suggestions for accuracy
- Verify artifact types are correct
- Check that all relevant suggestions are included

### After Artifact Creation

- Review artifacts for completeness
- Update artifacts with additional context if needed
- Use `/transition-plan` to create transition plans from artifacts (if available)
