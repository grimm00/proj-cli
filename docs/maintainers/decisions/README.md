## 📋 Quick Links

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

- **[ADR-0007: Unified CLI Tool Architecture](ADR-0007-unified-cli-architecture.md)** - CLI architecture, framework, and repository decisions (✅ Accepted)

---

## 🎯 Overview

This directory documents architectural decisions made for the project, following the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format. Each decision includes context, rationale, consequences, and references to supporting research.

### Decision Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** - Decision under consideration
2. **Approved** - Decision approved, ready for implementation
3. **Implemented** - Decision implemented and verified
4. **Superseded** - Decision replaced by a newer decision

└── [topic]/                    # Topic-specific decisions (created by /decision command)

## 🔄 Workflow

### Making Decisions

Use the `/decision` command to make decisions based on research:

```bash
/decision [topic-name] --from-research docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/research-summary.md
```

This creates:
- `docs/maintainers/decisions/[topic]/` directory
- ADR documents for each decision point
- `decisions-summary.md` - Summary of all decisions
- `README.md` - Topic decisions hub

### Decision → Planning

1. **Decision** (`/decision`) - Make architectural decisions, create ADRs
2. **Transition** (`/transition-plan`) - Transition to feature planning
