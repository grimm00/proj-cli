## 🔴 Issues and Gaps

### Missing Information

1. ~~**Error handler migration not explicit:**~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - Task 1 & 2 added
2. ~~**Command scope mismatch:**~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - Clarified: 8 commands in Phase 2
3. ~~**Test coverage goals:**~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - ≥70% specified
4. **Test data/fixtures:** ⚠️ **Deferred** - Will use work-prod API

### Potential Problems

1. ~~**API client missing methods:**~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - `archive_project()` added
2. ~~**Command discrepancy:**~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - Scope clarified (8 Phase 2, 4 deferred)
3. **Integration test dependency:** ⚠️ **Acknowledged** - Documented as prerequisite
4. ~~**API URL path difference:**~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - Consistent `/api/` prefix

### Improvement Opportunities

1. ~~Add `error_handler.py` as explicit Task~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - Tasks 1-2
2. ~~Clarify which commands are Phase 2 core vs deferred~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - Command Scope table
3. Add pytest fixtures for mocked API responses ⚠️ **Deferred to Phase 4**
4. ~~Define test coverage target~~ ✅ **Addressed 2025-12-17** - ≥70%

## 💡 Recommendations

### Before Implementation

1. ~~**Add error handler task:**~~ ✅ **Done** - Tasks 1-2 in phase-2.md
2. ~~**Clarify command scope:**~~ ✅ **Done** - 8 commands, 4 deferred
3. ~~**Add `archive` method:**~~ ✅ **Done** - In API client and commands
4. ~~**Define test coverage:**~~ ✅ **Done** - ≥70%

### During Implementation

1. **Create error handler first:** Tasks 1-2 (as planned)
2. **Mock API for tests:** ⚠️ **Deferred to Phase 4** - Use work-prod API for now
3. **Verify API paths:** ✅ **Done** - Consistent `/api/` prefix in templates
4. **Test incrementally:** Test each command as implemented

### Decision Required

~~**Command Scope for Phase 2:**~~ ✅ **Decided**
