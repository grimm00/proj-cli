## 📝 Deferred Enhancements

These are new enhancements identified during Phase 3 for future work:

### D1: Smart Dedupe with Field Merging

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

When dedupe finds duplicates from different sources (GitHub + local), it should merge the records instead of dropping one.

### D2: Multi-Directory Scan Configuration

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW
**Component:** `proj inv scan local`

Support config-driven multi-directory scanning with per-directory depth settings.

### D3: Exclusion Patterns for Scan

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW
**Component:** `proj inv scan local`

Add `--exclude` option for pattern-based directory exclusion.
